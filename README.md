# Simulation-of-remote-state-estimation
This project contains the matlab files of the report "Dynamic quantization for remote state estimation with reachable sets using Zonotopes"


main2D_set_based_method:
This is the simulation file for the set-based dynamic quantization scheme and the state reconstruction corresponding to Figure 3-6,8,10,12-13.

main2D_norm_based_method:
This is the simulation file for the norm-based dynamic quantization scheme corresponding to Figure 7,9,11.

The rest files are the necessary function. Control system toolbox and LMI toolbox are requiered.
